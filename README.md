# Recommendation Systems Unveiled
Welcome to a captivating journey through the fascinating world of recommendation systems! These powerful algorithms drive personalized suggestions across platforms like Spotify, Amazon, and Netflix, making your user experience unique. In this series of project, we'll dissect the magic behind these systems and uncover their inner workings. This recommendation systems project using data from the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) database.

## What's on the Menu?

1. Collaborative vs. Content-Based Filtering: We kick things off by exploring the fundamental concepts of recommendation systems. Dive into the realms of collaborative and content-based filtering, and learn how they shape your recommendations.

2. Implicit vs. Explicit Feedback: Not all user interactions are created equal. We'll unravel the distinction between implicit and explicit feedback and reveal how it influences recommendation engines.

3. The Cold Start Problem: Ever wondered how recommendation systems handle new users and items? The cold start problem is the answer. Join us as we tackle this challenge using clever clustering techniques.

4. Recommendation Model Evaluation: How do you know if your recommendations hit the mark? We'll guide you through the crucial process of evaluating recommendation models to ensure they're up to the task.

## Ready to Dive In?
To embark on this adventure, you'll need Python 3.6+, 3.7+, 3.8+, 3.9+, 3.10+, Jupyter Lab, and some essential libraries. Don't worry; I've got you covered with step-by-step project. And here's a secret: you can also explore these project on Google's Colab platform for a hassle-free experience.

## The Three Epic Chapters
### Part 1: Building an Item-Item Recommender with Collaborative Filtering

| |Description |
|:-----------|:----------|
|Objective: Ever wondered how Spotify, Amazon, and Netflix generate "similar item" recommendations for users? In this tutorial, we will build an item-item recommendation system by computing similarity using nearest-neighbor techniques |
|Key Concepts: Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, k-nearest neighbors, cosine similarity |
|Requirements: Python 3.6+, 3.7+, 3.8+, 3.9+, 3.10+, Jupyter Lab, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn |

### Part 2: Handling the Cold Start Problem with Content-based Filtering

| |Description |
|:-----------|:----------|
|Objective: Collaborative filtering struggles with new users and unrated items, known as the cold start problem. Join us in exploring clustering techniques used to tackle this challenge |
|Requirements: Python 3.6+, 3.7+, 3.8+, 3.9+, 3.10+, Jupyter Lab, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn |

### Part 3: Building an Implicit Feedback Recommender System

| |Description |
|:-----------|:----------|
|Objective: Implicit feedback, unlike explicit ratings, infers a user's preference from indirect interactions. We delve into a specialized recommender model tailored for implicit feedback datasets |
|Requirements: Python 3.6+, 3.7+, 3.8+, 3.9+, 3.10+,, Jupyter Lab, numpy, pandas, implicit library |

So, whether you're an aspiring data scientist or just curious about the magic behind your favorite recommendations, join me on this exhilarating journey into the world of recommendation systems. Let's uncover the secrets that power your personalized online experiences! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰


# Project Background
The main goal of the Recommendation Systems course is to help you understand the types of recommendation systems, how to evaluate recommendation systems, and create recommendation systems.
Through this project, we want to know:
* Your understanding of how recommendation systems work.
* Your understanding of how to evaluate recommendation systems.
* Your process of creating a recommendation system.

Step #1 - Choose a dataset
The first thing you do is select the dataset you want to complete. You can get the dataset from Kaggle (for convenience).
Some datasets that have user & item interactions are available on Kaggle:
* Netflix (movie)
* Spotify (music)
* Book recommendation dataset
* Anime recommendation database
* Restaurant recommendation
* Elo merchant category recommendation

Step #2 Define the objective of making recommendations
In this section, you have to determine a few things to envision the recommendation system that can be created.
* Describe the business problem that can occur
* Describe how to solve the business problem.


Step #3 - Recommender system
After understanding the business objective, you can select a suitable recommendation system to solve the objective. You need to describe:
* Framing of the recommender system, e.g. classification or regression or ranking
* The model of the recommendation system, e.g. non-personalized or personalized
* Describe how the chosen recommendation system works
* Describe how to evaluate the recommender system.
* Describe the workflow modeling that you did.

Step #4 - Analysis, conclusions, and references
The last step is to analyze and conclude your system. You must explain:
* How you experimented on the hyperparameters to improve the performance of the model.
* How you determined the best model.
* How you measure the performance of the recommendation system to optimize business objectives.
