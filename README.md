# Recommendation Systems Unveiled
Welcome to a captivating journey through the fascinating world of recommendation systems! These powerful algorithms drive personalized suggestions across platforms like Spotify, Amazon, and Netflix, making your user experience unique. In this series of project, we'll dissect the magic behind these systems and uncover their inner workings. This recommendation systems project using data from the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) database.

## What's on the Menu?

1. Collaborative vs. Content-Based Filtering: We kick things off by exploring the fundamental concepts of recommendation systems. Dive into the realms of collaborative and content-based filtering, and learn how they shape your recommendations.

2. Implicit vs. Explicit Feedback: Not all user interactions are created equal. We'll unravel the distinction between implicit and explicit feedback and reveal how it influences recommendation engines.

3. The Cold Start Problem: Ever wondered how recommendation systems handle new users and items? The cold start problem is the answer. Join us as we tackle this challenge using clever clustering techniques.

4. Recommendation Model Evaluation: How do you know if your recommendations hit the mark? We'll guide you through the crucial process of evaluating recommendation models to ensure they're up to the task.

## Ready to Dive In?
To embark on this adventure, you'll need Python 3.6+, 3.7+, 3.8+, 3.9+, 3.10+, Jupyter Lab, and some essential libraries. Don't worry; I've got you covered with step-by-step project. And here's a secret: you can also explore these project on Google's Colab platform for a hassle-free experience.

## The Three Epic Chapters
### Part 1: Building an Item-Item Recommender with Collaborative Filtering

| Description| |
|:-----------|:----------|
|Objective: Ever wondered how Spotify, Amazon, and Netflix generate "similar item" recommendations for users? In this tutorial, we will build an item-item recommendation system by computing similarity using nearest-neighbor techniques |
|Key Concepts: Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, k-nearest neighbors, cosine similarity |
|Requirements: Python 3.6+, 3.7+, 3.8+, 3.9+, 3.10+, Jupyter Lab, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn |

### Part 2: Handling the Cold Start Problem with Content-based Filtering

| Description| |
|:-----------|:----------|
|Objective: Collaborative filtering struggles with new users and unrated items, known as the cold start problem. Join us in exploring clustering techniques used to tackle this challenge |
|Requirements: Python 3.6+, 3.7+, 3.8+, 3.9+, 3.10+, Jupyter Lab, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn |

### Part 3: Building an Implicit Feedback Recommender System

| Description| |
|:-----------|:----------|
|Objective: Implicit feedback, unlike explicit ratings, infers a user's preference from indirect interactions. We delve into a specialized recommender model tailored for implicit feedback datasets |
|Requirements: Python 3.6+, 3.7+, 3.8+, 3.9+, 3.10+,, Jupyter Lab, numpy, pandas, implicit library |

So, whether you're an aspiring data scientist or just curious about the magic behind your favorite recommendations, join me on this exhilarating journey into the world of recommendation systems. Let's uncover the secrets that power your personalized online experiences! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰


# Project Background
The main goal of the Recommendation Systems course is to help you understand the types of recommendation systems, how to evaluate recommendation systems, and create recommendation systems.
Through this project, we want to know:
* Your understanding of how recommendation systems work.
* Your understanding of how to evaluate recommendation systems.
* Your process of creating a recommendation system.

Step #1 - Choose a Dataset:
Select the MovieLens dataset as your data source. The MovieLens dataset contains user-item interactions and is suitable for building a movie recommendation system.

Step #2 - Define the Objective:
Business Problem: The MoviePlatform wants to enhance user engagement and satisfaction by providing personalized movie recommendations to its users.
Solution: Develop a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences.

Step #3 - Recommender System:

Framing: Build a personalized recommendation system using collaborative filtering.
Model: Use user-item collaborative filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations.
How It Works: Collaborative filtering leverages user-item interactions to identify similar users or items. It recommends items that similar users have liked.
Evaluation: Evaluate the recommendation system using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
Step #4 - Analysis, Conclusions, and References:

Hyperparameter Experimentation: Experiment with hyperparameters such as the number of neighbors or similarity metrics to optimize the recommendation system's performance.
Best Model: Determine the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Performance Measurement: Measure the recommendation system's performance to ensure it aligns with business objectives.
Easy Report:

Business Problem and Objectives: Explain the goal of enhancing user engagement through personalized movie recommendations.
Recommendation System: Describe the collaborative filtering approach, how it works, and its evaluation.
Algorithm Implementation: Detail the steps to implement the recommendation system and how hyperparameters were tuned.
References: Cite any external sources or references used during the project.
This project plan provides a structured approach to creating a movie recommendation system for MoviePlatform. You can implement each step, document your progress, and create a comprehensive report at the end of the project to showcase your understanding of recommendation systems and your ability to address real-world business objectives.
